This paper investigates how online learning researchers understand feedback’s role in teaching and learning, and discusses how these understandings influence what research questions are asked, and what online feedback practices are recommended.

        "abstract": "There is growing recognition that electronic student information systems support college administrations and enhance student performance. These systems must fulfill their user’s needs (efficiently achieve their academic goals) while also providing a positive user experience (UX). This study used quantitative and qualitative approaches to elucidate students’ perceptions and investigate UX toward the SIS currently used at the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET), a higher education institution in Kuwait. Survey data collected from 645 PAAET students were analyzed to determine their perceptions of and experiences using this SIS. The findings revealed that students had a slightly positive UX with this SIS. The system’s perspicuity, stimulation, and dependability were rated slightly higher than its novelty, attractiveness, and efficiency." ,
